# finCLI-Chrome üöß

[finCLI](https://github.com/dhairyaostwal/finCLI) started in March,2020 as it's first release providing latest Finance updates on Command Line Interface. There were more releases including the home grown [news-api](https://fincli-news-api.herokuapp.com/) which enables the efficient and fast functioning of fetching latest and credible news on the internet < 1 hour of publishing.

We wanted to build more usage relevance hence coming up with a Chrome Extension which gets the latest information on topics like Indian Finance, Global Finance and Cryptocurrency Updates.
